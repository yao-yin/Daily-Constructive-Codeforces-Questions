# Daily-Constructive-Codeforces-Questions
A constructive question a day, keep the stupidity away.

## Why

I have ~2400 leetcode contest rating, most of leetcode problems are not challenging and interesting. Meanwhile my codeforces rating and atcoder rating is stuck at around 1600-1700 and 1400-1500, respectively. Get inspired from [the Zhihu answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/339795230/answer/868748153) and [the codeforces comment](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66715?#comment-507869), I decide to follow this way to improve my problem solving ability.

## A deeper why

## Plan

My current rating is 1658 (max. 1748) on codeforces. I will pick questions with constructive algorithms label in range {1800, 1900, 2000} (roughly my rating + 200), and solve them 1 per weekday on average (I might be super busy on Wed). 

Season #1:
June 20th, 2022 ~ ~~September 18th, 2022~~ July 24th, 2022 (backfilled on July 31st, 2022)

```
Solved (AC) by my own / Learned from the tutorial
1800:  3 / 0
1900:  5 / 1
2000:  9 / 6
2100:  0 / 1
```

## Summary of S1

Thanks to these constructive problems, I feel my intuition on resolving algorithmic problems become stronger. Stop the S1 training ahead of the plan because I become much busier than I expected. 

Another reason is that I have to make preparation for real interview problems and CS fundamentals. The marginal utility of spending 5 hours on codeforces per week is just not high for me at the current stage.
