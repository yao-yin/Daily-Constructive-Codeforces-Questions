# Daily-Constructive-Codeforces-Questions
A constructive question a day, keep the stupidity away.

## Why

I have ~2400 leetcode contest rating, most of leetcode problems are not challenging and interesting. Meanwhile my codeforces rating and atcoder rating is stuck at around 1600-1700 and 1400-1500, respectively. Get inspired from [the Zhihu answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/339795230/answer/868748153) and [the codeforces comment](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66715?#comment-507869), I decide to follow this way to improve my problem solving ability.

## A deeper why

## Plan

My current rating is 1658 (max. 1748) on codeforces. I will pick questions with constructive algorithms label in range {1800, 1900, 2000} (roughly my rating + 200), and solve them 1 per weekday on average (I might be super busy on Wed).
